    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Creamy and buttery Dal Makhani is one of India’s most loved dal!

        This dal has whole black lentils cooked with butter and cream and simmered on low heat for that unique flavor. It tastes best with garlic naan!
        
        I share all my tips and tricks to make restaurant style Dal Makhani at home with easy to follow steps.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>1 tablespoon ghee
            ▢3 tablespoons butter divided, use amul butter (salted) if possible
            ▢1 medium white onion 115 grams, finely grated using a food processor
            ▢2 teaspoons ginger garlic paste use fresh paste if possible
            ▢1/2 cup tomato puree use store bought tomato puree
            ▢1/2 teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder
            ▢1/4 teaspoon garam masala
            ▢1/2 teaspoon salt or to taste
            ▢1.5 cups water 12 oz, as needed
            ▢1/2 teaspoon sugar
            ▢1/4 cup cream 60 ml
            ▢more amul butter (salted) for serving
            ▢piece of charcoal optional, for giving dal a smokey flavor</p>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <p>Wash and rinse urad dal (whole black lentil) and rajma (kidney beans) in a large bowl. Soak in 3 cups water overnight.
                In the morning, drain the water in which the dal and rajma was soaked. Transfer the dal and rajma to a pressure cooker with 1 teaspoon salt. Add around 3.5 cups water. 
                Pressure cook on high-medium heat for 10 whistles, then lower the heat to low-medium and cook for another 10 minutes. In total around 15 to 20 whistles.
                Let the pressure release naturally. The dal and rajma should be completely cooked and you should be able to mash them with your fingers. 
                If using the Instant pot, pressure cook the lentils on high pressure for 30 minutes with natural pressure release.
                Mash some of the dal and rajma using a potato masher. Then turn on the heat to lowest heat and let the dal simmer while you make the masala.</p>
